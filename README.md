3. Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected charges

### Privacy

This game will run locally on your computer and does not send any information or data to any outside servers or services.

### OpenAI API Usage Details

- **Models Used**: The game utilizes GPT models (gpt-4o-mini) for text generation and DALL-E models for image creation
- **Token Consumption**: Each game session will consume tokens based on:
  - Length of your adventure
  - Complexity of your choices
  - Number of images generated
- **Cost Considerations**: While costs are generally modest for typical gameplay sessions, they can add up with extended use.

### Recommended API Practices for controlling cost and ensuring security
